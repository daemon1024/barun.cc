## Hey there, I'm Barun ðŸ‘‹

I am a undergraduate student working on some cool open-source projects.

Currently, I am tinkering with - Infrastructure, Container Security and Cloud Native.

I have been involved with [Public Lab Code Community under Google Summer of Code '21](/posts/gsoc21)

You can usually find me lurking around at [Open Source Developers Community](https://osdc.netlify.app/)

If you want to check some of my stuff out then you can do that! at [Github Profile](https://github.com/daemon1024)

I like to talk about { `Open Source`, `Community`, `Go`, `Javascript`, `Cloud`, `Web`, `Privacy`, `Linux`, `Anime`, `Mechanical Keyboards` }
